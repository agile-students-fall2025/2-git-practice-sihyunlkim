## Interesting Article in Softeware Development

I found this article very interesting and thought-provoking: [You Are Not Google](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb)

## Why I Found It Interesting  

This article by **Ozan Onay** really made me rethink how often developers fall into the trap of copying what *big tech companies* do, even when it doesn’t fit their own context. Onay explains that **Google’s engineering choices** are driven by their *massive scale, unique problems, and extraordinary resources*, factors that simply don’t apply to most projects.  

> *“What problem does this actually solve for us?”*  

That question stood out to me as a practical test before adopting new tools or architecture patterns. What I took away most is the reminder that software engineering is not about using the **flashiest technology**, but about solving problems in ways that are **appropriate, maintainable, and reliable**. Sometimes the *simplest solution*—the one everyone understands—is the best option, even if it doesn’t look as impressive on a résumé. As someone still learning to **balance ambition with practicality** in my coding projects, I found this perspective both *grounding* and *motivating*.

## Comment by Amy Liao

I really liked this article choice! I agree that it’s easy to be tempted by the architectures and tools that big companies like Google use, but often those are way too complex for the problems most of us face.  

What resonated with me is the idea of focusing on **fit-for-purpose solutions** — not just what looks impressive or “industry standard.” As a student developer, I find it encouraging to remember that clarity and maintainability can be stronger signals of good engineering than flashy frameworks. Thanks for sharing this article, Sihyun!
